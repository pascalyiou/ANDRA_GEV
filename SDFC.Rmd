## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

size = 2000
XY = SDFC::dataset(size)
t  = XY$t
X_loc = XY$X_loc
```

```{r}
loc   = 0.5 + 2 * X_loc
scale = 1.2 + 0 * X_loc
shape = -0.2 + 0 * X_loc
Y     = ROOPSD::rgev( loc = loc , scale = scale , shape = shape , n = size )
```

```{r}
gev = SDFC::GEV$new()
gev$fit( Y , c_loc = X_loc , l_scale = SDFC::ULExponential$new() )
print(gev$coef_)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
